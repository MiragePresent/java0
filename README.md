## Learning and playing with Java

The current version of the project contains a simple "Hello world!" application. The app is generated by maven using `maven-archetype-quickstart`

## Running application

The app can be simply executed with docker-compose

```shell
docker compose up
```

## Tools

**Code formatter** -- to format code run the next command 

```shell
# locally
mvn formatter:format
# or from container
docker compose run java0 mnv formatter:format
```

## TODO

- [ ] Finish formatting setup
- [ ] Add DB and test connection
